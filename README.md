## Technologies

- **Frontend:** React, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Database:** [Your choice of database, e.g., SQL Server, SQLite]
- **State Management:** [e.g., React Hooks, Context API, etc.]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or later)
- [ASP.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (v3.1 or later)
- [Your choice of database](#)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xisxus/React-CRUD.git
git clone https://github.com/xisxus/AspNetCoreWebApi-CRUD.git
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the React project directory:

    ```bash
    cd React-CRUD
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the ASP.NET Core Web API project directory:

    ```bash
    cd AspNetCoreWebApi-CRUD
    ```

2. Restore the dependencies:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

3. Update your database connection string in `appsettings.json`.

4. Run the migrations (if any):

    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

5. Start the ASP.NET Core Web API:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

## API Documentation

Refer to the API documentation in the backend repository to understand the endpoints available for CRUD operations. Here are some common endpoints:

- `GET /api/items` - Get all items.
- `GET /api/items/{id}` - Get a specific item by ID.
- `POST /api/items` - Create a new item.
- `PUT /api/items/{id}` - Update an existing item.
- `DELETE /api/items/{id}` - Delete an item.

## Usage

Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the React application. You can now create, read, update, and delete items using the user interface.
